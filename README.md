# AKAR Flutter Project Contribution Guide

This guide will help you fork a Flutter project from GitHub, set it up, make changes, and send a pull request back to the original repository.

## Prerequisites

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- An IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. **Sign in to GitHub:**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account.

2. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Navigate to the original repository you want to contribute to.
   - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Clone Your Fork

1. **Clone the Forked Repository:**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git

   - Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `repository` with the name of the forked repository.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```sh
   cd repository
   ```

## Step 3: Set Up the Project

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Run the Project:**
   - Connect a physical device or start an emulator.
   ```sh
   flutter run
   ```

## Step 4: Make Changes to the Project

1. **Create a New Branch:**
   - It's good practice to create a new branch for your changes.
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
   - Replace `feature-branch` with a descriptive name for your branch.

2. **Open the Project in an IDE:**
   - Open the project in an IDE such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.

3. **Modify Code:**
   - Navigate through the project files in the `lib` directory and make your desired changes.
   - For example, to change the main screen, modify `lib/main.dart`.

4. **Hot Reload:**
   - If the project is running and you make changes to the Dart code, use hot reload to see changes immediately. Just press `r` in the terminal where `flutter run` is running, or use the hot reload button in your IDE.

## Step 5: Test and Commit Changes

1. **Test Your Changes:**
   - Ensure your changes work correctly by running the app and testing the new functionality.

2. **Stage and Commit Your Changes:**
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your changes here"
   ```

## Step 6: Push Changes to GitHub

1. **Push Your Changes:**
   ```sh
   git push origin feature-branch
   ```
   - Replace `feature-branch` with the name of your branch.

## Step 7: Create a Pull Request

1. **Navigate to Your Forked Repository:**
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.

2. **Compare & Pull Request:**
   - Click the "Compare & pull request" button.
   - Ensure the base repository is the original repository and the base branch is the branch you want to merge into.
   - Ensure the head repository is your forked repository and the compare branch is the branch you made changes on.

3. **Submit Pull Request:**
   - Add a title and description for your pull request.
   - Click the "Create pull request" button.

By following these steps, you should be able to fork a Flutter project from GitHub, set it up, make changes, and send a pull request back to the original repository. If you encounter any issues, just leave a comment.
